<h1>Jimic</h1>
<p>Jimic is a minimalistic eComic viewer for Java platforms supporting JDK 1.1 and AWT.
It allows to read eComics stored in CBZ format with images encoded in JFIF/JPEG or GIF format.
To read comics or images in other formats, they first have to be converted (for example using
<a href="http://jomic.sourceforge.net/">Jomic</a>).</p>

<h2>Features and limitations</h2>

<p>Jimic is designed to be simple and small:</p>

<ul>
<li>Maximum screen real estate due lack of menus, toolbars and anything else not related to showing images.</li>
<li>No write access needed. Images are read directly from the eComic ZIP archive, and extracted to memory.</li>
<li>Tiny application size.</li>
<li>Runs with JDK 1.1 and AWT (as released way back in 1997).</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of its simplicity, a few things you might have been used to from other eComic viewers are missing.
The limitations are by design, and not considered bugs.</p>

<ul>
<li>No scrollbar to move within the image (because it would waste screen space).</li>
<li>No online help; you have to learn the keyboard definition by heart (it's simple though because there isn't much you can do with Jimic anyway).</li>
<li>No two page mode.</li>
<li>No caching and precaching.</li>
<li>Read only one comic at a time.</li>
<li>No different view modes like "scale to fit" (because handheld displays are usually to small for that anyway).</li>
</ul>

<p>And there are a couple of issues that ought to be addressed eventually:</p>

<ul>
<li>Scrolling should only be allowed within the image range.</li>
<li>Image names should be sorted naturally instead of alphabetically (23 comes before 123).</li> 
</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>Jimic requires a Java and its Abstract Windowing Toolkit (AWT). These have been available since
1997, and are supported by pretty much everything that claims Java with GUI support.</p>

<h2>Installation and startup</h2>

<p>To install Jimic, unpack <code>Jimic.zip</code> and simply copy the <code>Jimic.jar</code> to 
any place you like.</p>

<p>To start Jimic from the console, type:</p>

<pre>java -jar /install/path/Jimic.jar</pre>

<p>Optionally you can specify a file name of a comic to open, for example:</p>

<pre>java -jar /install/path/Jimic.jar /comics/blah.cbz</pre>

<p>On many platforms you can also start Jimic from the desktop by just double-clicking the <code>Jimic.jar</code>.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Jimic opens an empty window. Press one of the following keys:</p>

<ul>
<li>O - Open a dialog to select a comic to read.</li>
<li>A - Show dialog with information about the application such as version number and copyright.</li>
<li>Page up, page down, Space - Go to previous/next image.</li>
<li>Cursor keys - scroll image.</li>
<li>G or L - Open a dialog to select the numer of an image to show.</li>
<li>Q or Esc - Quit the application.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally you can use the mouse:</p>

<ul>
<li>Click left - Go to next image.</li>
<li>Drag with left button pressed - Scroll image.</li>
</ul>
