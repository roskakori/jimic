Jimic Changes
-------------

(Most current version on top)

Version 0.7, 09-Jul-2006

- Fixed references to methods and constants not part of JDK 1.1.
- Fixed that on some platforms (Mac OS X) the application kept running 
  after closing the window using "quit" by calling System.exit().
- Fixed IOException on Mac OS Classic when reading an image because 
  InputStream.read(array) did not read the whole image even of the target 
  array was big enough. Now the read() loops until all bytes are read.
- Fixed ugly stripes of previous image when scrolling or changing the 
  image to a smaller one.
- Changed default size of window to just cover a large area of the screen 
  instead of the whole. This fixes that on some platforms the window became 
  to big because the stupid getScreenSize() function does not consider 
  taskbars and stuff like that.
- Changed cursor type during opening a comic to "wait cursor".
- Changed image to be centered after changing the page (if the window is 
  big enough).
- Added this file to describe changes.
- Added homepage at <http://www.roskakori.at/jimic/>.

Version 0.6, 08-Jul-2006

- Fixed flickering when dragging image.
- Fixed NullPointerException when dragging image without any comic loaded.
- Fixed NullPointerException after failing to open a comic.
- Fixed NullPointerException when starting to drag image.
- Changed error messages to be shown in a dialog instead of the console.
- Changed background color from system default to gray.
- Changed mouse pointer to "move pointer" during dragging the image.

Version 0.5, 05-Jul-2006

- First public release.
